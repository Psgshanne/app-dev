**STORY PLOT**

Shin Ha-ri goes on a blind date after she agrees to replace her friend, Jin Young-seo, whose father had arranged it. The plan is to have Ha-ri 'getting rejected' by her prospective partner. However, it goes awry when her date turns out to be Kang Tae-moo, CEO of Go Food, the company where Ha-ri works. Tae-moo, who is being pressured by his grandfather Kang Da-goo, the chairman of Go Food's parent company, to go on blind dates with suitable marriage partners, decides to marry his blind date partner to avoid going on the rest of the dates, without knowing she is the fake Jin Young-seo or that she is his employee, which she assiduously tries to hide. However, Ha-ri's fake identity, but thankfully not her employment status, is soon exposed after the real Jin Young-seo confesses to Kang Tae-moo of 'hiring' an actress to impersonate her on her blind date with Tae-moo. She meets Cha Sung-hoon during her exchange with Kang Tae-moo, and finds out that Sung-hoon is Tae-moo's secretary.

After Ha-ri's identity is exposed, Young-seo tricks Ha-ri into meeting with Tae-moo at his request. When he asks for her real name, Ha-ri lies and says that her name is Shin Geum-hui the same name as the female lead of a popular fictional television series Be Strong, Geum-hui to hide that she is his employee. Tae-moo bullies and bribes Ha-ri into pretending to be his fianc√©e in exchange for a payment of 800,000 won per date after his grandfather threatens to send him on countless blind dates. The cash-strapped Ha-ri desperately needs the money to bail out her consistently impecunious parents, so she accepts. During the course of fake dating, Ha-ri uses her new identity alongside a fake background, created for her by Tae-moo and Sunghoon, to make a good first impression on Tae-moo's grandfather. While the relationship starts out frosty and uncomfortable, the couple soon grows closer until Tae-moo finds out Ha-ri's real identity. Despite feeling betrayed, Tae-moo still loves Ha-ri and they later became a couple as he told Ha-ri he knew the truth of her identity.

Meantime, Young-seo moves out of her father's house to escape his demands to attend blind dates and finds out, in a comic moment involving a marauding cockroach, that she is now Sung-hoon's neighbor, the man with whom she had become infatuated at first sight after meeting him at a convenience store. While Young-seo is attracted to him, Sung-hoon is upset with her for deceiving his boss, so he constantly tries to avoid her. Still, he cannot further deny his growing affections for Young-seo when he realizes it eventually, and they get together
